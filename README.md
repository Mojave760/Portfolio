# Tyler Rollinson - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me
I hold a Bachelor of Applied Art and Science in Data Analytics and Marketing from the University of North Texas, where I developed strong proficiency in tools like Excel, R, and SQL. My academic work has equipped me with solid experience in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, data modeling, and data visualization, enabling me to work effectively with complex datasets. I approach data analysis with a thorough and analytical mindset, ensuring accuracy and clarity in my work. Through various projects, I have cultivated a deep understanding of how to extract meaningful insights from data.

My interest in data analytics was first sparked while working Cruise, where I was involved in with autonomous vehicle testing. Working in such a data-driven industry made me increasingly curious about the vast amount of information that drives this technology. This hands on experience paired with background in architecture, where I developed an appreciation for the research and data that informs design decisions, I began to see how powerful data can be in shaping both physical and technological landscapes. This cross-section of experiences fueled my desire to dive deeper into data analytics, where I can combine my analytical mindset with a deep curiosity for discovering the stories that data holds.
